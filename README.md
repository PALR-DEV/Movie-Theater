## Executive Summary

This case study examines the business benefits of implementing an online ticket purchasing system for movie theaters that currently only use their website to display movie information and showtimes. The analysis demonstrates how transitioning to a complete e-commerce solution creates substantial value through increased revenue streams, enhanced customer experience, valuable data collection opportunities, and improved operational efficiency.

The implementation showcased in this repository serves as a practical demonstration of how such a system can be developed using modern web technologies, providing a blueprint for theater owners looking to modernize their ticketing operations.

## Business Challenge

Many independent and small-chain theaters face significant challenges in today's competitive entertainment landscape:

- **Limited Advance Sales**: Without online purchasing, theaters can only sell tickets at the box office, missing opportunities for advance purchases and planning.
- **Customer Friction**: Potential customers must physically visit the theater to purchase tickets or call for information, creating friction in the customer journey.
- **Inventory Management**: Manual ticketing systems make it difficult to accurately track seat availability and optimize theater capacity.
- **Market Intelligence Gap**: Limited data collection prevents theaters from understanding customer preferences and optimizing their offerings.
